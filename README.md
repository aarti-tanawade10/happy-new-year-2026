🎉 New Year 2026 Celebration Page
A minimalist and aesthetic web page to celebrate the arrival of 2026. This project features floating text animations, a dynamic color-shifting message, and a high-performance particle "glitter" effect powered by HTML5 Canvas.

✨ Features
* Floating 2026: A subtle vertical animation for the year.
* Color-Shift Message: The "HAPPY NEW YEAR" text smoothly transitions between Red, Blue, and Green with a glowing neon effect.
* Interactive Sparks: 150+ dynamically generated "sparks" that move across the screen and twinkle (glitter).
* Responsive Design: Automatically adjusts the canvas size when the window is resized.

🛠️ Built With
* HTML5 - For the document structure.
* CSS3 - For Flexbox centering and Keyframe animations.
* JavaScript - For the Canvas particle system and physics logic.

📂 Code Highlights
CSS Animations
The project uses @keyframes to create smooth transitions:

float: Moves the year 2026 up and down.

colorShift: Cycles colors and adjusts the text-shadow for a glow effect.

JavaScript Particle System
The sparks are created using an Object-Oriented approach. Each "Star" is an object with its own:
X and Y coordinates.
Velocity (speed).
Twinkle logic (randomizing opacity).


🥂 Happy New Year!
Celebrate 2026 with clean code and smooth animations.
